# Coaching

## 1. Technical Approach & Next Steps:

- Core Technology: Focus on using Transformer models.
- Initial Action:
  - Try Llama 2 and fine-tune it to get initial results.
  - Alternatively: Use any transformer model that is computationally efficient for a quick start.

# 2. Presentation Guidance:

- Structure: Organize the presentation logically, following a clear narrative ("red string"):
  - Start with the objective ("what did we want").
  - Explain the chosen approach ("what path did we choose").
  - Include relevant context/steps ("etc.").
- Visuals: Use graphics to illustrate high-level concepts effectively.
